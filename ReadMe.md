# Welcome

I'm using this to learn more about Python Flask backend and NextJS frontend. I'm opting to use Python as the backend because yt-dlp is python-based and I'm more familiar with Python.

The backend is bad JSON files. I'll move this to MongoDB, SQLLite, or a serverless later.

This is based on / inspired by the below GitHub Repos.
